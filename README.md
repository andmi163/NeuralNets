# NeuralNets
Simple implementation of regression and classification using a feedforward Neural Network.

The NN architecture is very simple and follows the original paper by Rumelhart, Hinton & Williams (https://doi.org/10.1038/323533a0).
Implementation was done as part of the doctoral course: "Classical Articles".

### Regression: 
Function approximation. Specifically approximating sin(x)

### Classification:
Classification of handwritten digits. Training and testing using the MNIST dataset
